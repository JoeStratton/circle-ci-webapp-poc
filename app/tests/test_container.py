"""
Container and Integration Tests

This test suite provides container-level and integration testing for the Flask
application in a more realistic environment that mirrors production deployment.

Test Categories:
- Container integration tests (application running in Docker)
- Database sidecar connectivity testing  
- Security configuration validation
- Performance characteristics testing
- Environment configuration testing

Container Testing Strategy:
- Tests application behavior when containerized
- Validates PostgreSQL sidecar container connectivity
- Tests container security (non-root user, minimal attack surface)
- Validates health check endpoints in container context
- Tests environment variable configuration

Database Integration:
- PostgreSQL sidecar container testing (production-like)
- Database initialization and connectivity
- Container-to-container communication testing
- Database migration and schema validation

CircleCI Integration:
- Container tests run after Docker image build
- Uses dgoss for container behavior validation
- Validates port availability and process health
- Tests HTTP endpoints in containerized environment
- Results collected as JUnit XML for CircleCI UI

Production Simulation:
- Tests multi-container deployment scenario
- Validates ECS task definition compatibility
- Tests container startup sequences and dependencies
- Validates health check timing and retry logic
